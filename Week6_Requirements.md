# Week 6: Public Website (Home Page) + Dashboard Link Integration

## Overview
This week focused on building the public-facing main website home page while preserving the existing protected dashboard and authentication flow.

The goal was to deliver a polished, responsive, and ADA-aware home experience with:
- public navigation,
- connection points to authentication and dashboard,
- dark/light mode support,
- mobile-friendly navigation,
- accessible hover/focus behavior,
- and a placeholder route for future live activity monitoring.

### 2) Public Navigation + Future Pages Visibility
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Implemented:**

- Future pages (`About`, `Services`, `Contact`) remain visible but marked as coming soon.
- Auth actions in header: `Sign In`, `Sign Up`, `Dashboard`.

**Behavior:**

- existing auth guard logic preserved

---

### 4) Cross-Linking Between Public Site and Dashboard
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Implemented:**
- Public header includes `Dashboard` button.
- Dashboard navbar includes `Main Site` button.
- Both cross-site buttons were styled to be highly noticeable and then refined for contrast.

**Files:**

---

### 5) Mobile Navigation Experience
**Status:** ✅ Completed

### 7) Accessibility (ADA) Improvements

- Added/strengthened focus-visible styles for keyboard users.
- Updated disabled/future nav items to better semantics and readability.
- Added reduced-motion support for animated elements.
- Added hover/focus reveal behavior for coverage cards with layout-shift prevention.

**Key UX/ADA Fixes:**

- Hero/CTA/nav/footer readability improved.
- Interaction states (hover/focus/disabled) are clearer.

---

### 8) Live Activity Placeholder Route
**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Implemented:**
- Hero secondary action changed from `Learn More` to `Live Activity`.
- Added temporary page route for future real-time disaster/weather activity.

**Files:**
- `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`
- `src/pages/LiveActivityPage.jsx`
- `src/App.jsx` (`/live-activity` route)
